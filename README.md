The article I have chosen details the Internet Computer's mission statement. This is a new and innovative blockchain platform that is looking to reinvent the way in which we develop and maintain software as well as removing the reliance on big tech as the internet's middle men. 

The platform is designed so that developers can host web applications natively on the blockchain. The Internet Computer will eventually look to replace Ethereum as the price of gas on the Ethereum network continues to rise. Furthermore, removing the need for 3rd party web services also removes their imposed constraints. Hopefully this will lead to a renaissance in creativity and innovation in the software industry.
