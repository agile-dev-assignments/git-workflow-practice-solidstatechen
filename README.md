The article I have chosen details the Internet Computer's mission statement. This is a new and innovative blockchain platform that is looking to reinvent the way in which we develop and maintain software as well as removing the reliance on big tech as the internet's middle men. 

The platform is designed so that developers can host web applications natively on the blockchain. The Internet Computer will eventually look to replace Ethereum as the price of gas on the Ethereum network continues to rise. Furthermore, removing the need for 3rd party web services also removes their imposed constraints. Hopefully this will lead to a renaissance in creativity and innovation in the software industry. 

## Comment (Giovanni Ciccia)
This article presents an exciting new possibility for the internet. I think The Internet Computer is a great application of blockchain  technology that uses its capabilities of creating decentralized systems in order to create a more "democratic" internet. However, one issue to consider is how we would be able to regulate things like hate speech or disinformation in this new internet. Nowadays, we can hold big tech companies accountable for what they allow to happen on their platforms. I don't fully understand the technology behind the ICP, but it seems to me that doing this kind of regulation would be harder.
